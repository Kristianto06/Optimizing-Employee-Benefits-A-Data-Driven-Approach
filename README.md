This data can be sourced from publicly available datasets, HR systems, or simulated data for analysis.

## Technologies Used ⚙️

This project utilizes a variety of tools and technologies to perform data analysis and create predictive models:

- **Python** 🐍
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `tableau` for visualization
  - `numpy` for numerical operations
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning models
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive analysis and visualization

## Analysis & Insights 🔍

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we uncover key patterns related to employee turnover. Some example insights include:

## Modeling 🤖

This section focuses on predicting employee retention using machine learning models. We explore the following:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
2. **Model Selection**: Building classification models to predict if an employee will leave or stay.
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost
3. **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.

The best-performing model can be deployed to predict future employee retention and guide HR strategies.
