# Optimizing Employee Benefits: A Data-Driven Approach 📊
The primary objective of this project is to conduct a thorough analysis current employee benefits program to identify areas for improvement and optimization. By leveraging data-driven insights, we aim to develop a benefits package that is both cost-effective and highly valued by our employees.

## Project Overview 🚀
"Imagine this: a factory worker is able to return to work sooner after receiving emergency dental care due to an accident, thanks to the coverage provided by their company's health benefits plan. A mother of a child born deaf doesn't have to sell her assets to pay for a hearing aid because her company's health plan covers congenital conditions. Financial crises due to the costs of hemodialysis or ICU care can be avoided, thanks to the comprehensive insurance coverage provided by the company.

Employee benefits, particularly health benefits, are more than just perks; they are the foundation of a productive workforce. When our marketing team receives a request from a company to design a health benefits program for their employees and families, we see more than just numbers on a spreadsheet. We see the people behind those numbers: a father worried about the cost of his child's physical therapy exceeding his monthly salary, a mother stressed about choosing between paying for a hearing aid or school fees, or a young worker traumatized by a workplace accident.

An employee health program is not just about mitigating the risk of injury or illness. It's about creating a humane work environment where every employee feels protected – from a simple doctor's consultation for a cough to financial support for chemotherapy or ICU care. The goal of such a program is not only to reduce absenteeism but also to foster loyalty and productivity.

We call this 'empathetic productivity'. Every dollar invested in employee health is an investment in the sustainability of the business and the trust of employees."

## Analysis & Insights 🔍

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we uncover key patterns related to employee turnover. Some example insights include:

Identifying trends, HR teams can create targeted strategies to improve employee satisfaction and reduce unnecessary turnover.

## Dataset 📈

Dataset Description

This dataset contains 59,999 records, each representing a unique medical claim. It provides valuable insights into various aspects of healthcare claims processing.

Key Variables

Patient Information:

Member ID: Unique identifier for each individual patient.
Location: Geographic location associated with the patient.
Claim Details:

Claim_No: Unique identifier for each claim.
type: Type of claim (e.g., inpatient, outpatient, dental).
ServiceStartDate: Date when the medical service began.
ServiceStartEnd: Date when the medical service ended.
Days: Duration of the service.
ProviderName: Name of the healthcare provider.
Service Information:

BenefitDescription: General description of the service provided.
DetailDescription: Detailed description of the service or procedure.
ProductCode: Code representing the specific insurance plan or product.
Diagnosis & Procedure:

icd_code: International Classification of Diseases code for diagnosis.
methode: Method of service delivery (e.g., in-person, telemedicine).
Financial Information:

BilledAmount: Total amount billed by the healthcare provider.
ApprovedAmount: Amount approved for payment by the insurance company.
ShortfallAmount: Amount not covered by insurance.
Data Types

Integers: Index, Days
Strings: Location, Member ID, Claim_No, ProviderName, BenefitDescription, DetailDescription, ProductCode, icd_code, methode
Dates: ServiceStartDate, ServiceStartEnd
Floats: BilledAmount, ApprovedAmount, ShortfallAmount
Key Improvements:

Enhanced Readability: Using bullet points and spacing improves readability.
Clearer Sectioning: The description is divided into sections for better organization (Patient Information, Claim Details, etc.).
Conciseness: Removed redundant phrases while maintaining clarity.
Consistent Formatting: Consistent use of capitalization and spacing enhances the visual appeal.

## Tools ⚙️

This project utilizes a variety of tools and technologies to perform data analysis and create predictive models:

- **Python** 🐍
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `tableau` for visualization
  - `numpy` for numerical operations
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning models
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive analysis and visualization

## Modeling 🤖

This section focuses on predicting employee retention using machine learning models. We explore the following:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
2. **Model Selection**: Building classification models to predict if an employee will leave or stay.
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost
3. **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.

The best-performing model can be deployed to predict future employee retention and guide HR strategies.
